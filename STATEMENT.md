Bill Management System for Hotels and Restaurants

Problem Statement

Hotels and restaurants manage a large number of customer orders, invoices, and payments on a daily basis. Manual billing processes are time‑consuming, prone to calculation errors, and difficult to track. Lack of a centralized billing system leads to issues such as delayed service, inconsistent bill records, difficulty in managing taxes, and challenges in generating reports for business analysis. A digital bill management system is required to streamline billing operations, improve accuracy, and enhance customer experience.

Scope of the Project

Design and develop a digital billing system for hotels and restaurants.

Support creation, modification, and printing of customer bills.

Manage menu items, pricing, taxes, discounts, and service charges.

Maintain records of past transactions for auditing and analysis.

Provide secure user access for staff and managers.

Include reporting features (daily, weekly, monthly sales reports).

The system will focus only on billing workflows and not cover inventory management or reservation systems.


Target Users

Restaurants (small, medium, and large scale)

Hotels with in‑house dining services

Cashiers and billing staff

Restaurant managers and hotel administrators

Cloud‑kitchen and takeaway service providers
